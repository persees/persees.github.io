<p style='text-align: justify;'>For the last years, I have been doing security audits to internal networks, websites and most recently to IoT devices. I have worked both on the private and public sector, including the Portugal Ministry of Internal Affairs. During that time i am/was also part of the multiple SOCs within the companies to help out with critical incident responses.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>I like to keep up with the news about cybersecurity, and for that reason, I dedicate part of my free time to learn new techniques, tools (either creating them or use new ones) and to take on security certifications. Currently I am OSCP certified and plan on taking OSEP from Offensive Security.</p>

I also like to play CTFs on the weekends with my team!
